# "Social" muting
A chrome/Brave plugin to mute words on LinkedIn and Facebook

One thing I like about X/Twitter, Mastodon, and Bluesky is that they offer the ability "mute" posts based on keywords.

A lot of social media sites would be better if they had this ability. So here is my attempt to make the on-line
world a better place.

This was also inspired by a certain "social network" and their inability to prevent certain types of spam posts. Now,
I can take the power back and block the offending posts myself.

This was one-shotted by Claude. There might be bugs, buyer beware.
